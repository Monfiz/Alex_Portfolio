# Alex Portfolio

Hi, my name is Alejandro MuÃ±oz. Welcome to my public portfolio, where I share my data science skills.

Iâ€™m a physics engineer and a data science student at ITAM. I have a deep interest in science and the understanding of the world, and also shearing that knowledge. More about me and my interests [here](https://github.com/Monfiz/Alex_Portfolio/blob/main/About_alex.md).  

Here you can find my CV in [Spanish]( https://github.com/Monfiz/Alex_Portfolio/blob/main/CV_2022_espaÃ±ol.pdf) and in [English]( https://github.com/Monfiz/Alex_Portfolio/blob/main/CV_2022_English.pdf) where you can see mostly my academic career and associative life.

On this portfolio currently you can find 3 projects:
## [Project 1 - Hotel Cancelations Predictor:]( https://github.com/Monfiz/Alex_Portfolio/tree/main/Project_1)

On this project I make use of **machine learning models** such as **linear regression** with **lasso** and **random forest** to make a prediction if a hotel reservation is going to be canceled or not. The code is built in R. 

## [Project 2 â€“ Movie Clustering and Movie Revenue Prediction:]( https://github.com/Monfiz/Alex_Portfolio/tree/main/Project_2)

This project is subdivided into two smaller ones, the first is an **unsupervised machine learning algorithm** that makes **clusters** of movies to make recommendations that are similar to an specific movie. The second one is a predictor of how much revenue a movie will make. For this second problem I use several models like **nearest neighbor**, **decision tree**, **random forest**, **linear regression** and more. The code is built in Python.

## [Project 3 â€“ Analysis of coding and non-coding DNA:](https://github.com/Monfiz/Alex_Portfolio/tree/main/Project_3)

On this project I apply the [multifractal theory]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifractal_system#:~:text=A%20multifractal%20system%20is%20a,systems%20are%20common%20in%20nature.) to make an analysis of the complexity of the coding and [non-coding DNA]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_DNA#:~:text=Non-coding%20DNA%20sequences%20are,do%20not%20encode%20protein%20sequences.&text=Other%20functions%20of%20non-coding,DNA%20replication%2C%20centromeres%20and%20telomeres.). But first, I justify the use of this theory by showing that the DNA presents a multifractal structure. The code is built in Python. Here I show my maths and coding skills applied to solve a specific problem, in this case a bioinformatics one.
