# Alex Portfolio

Hi, my name is Alejandro Muñoz. Welcome to my public portfolio, where I share my data science skills.

I’m a physics engineer and a data science student at ITAM. I have a deep interest in science and the understanding of the world, and also shearing that knowledge. More about me and my interests [here](https://github.com/Monfiz/Alex_Portfolio/blob/main/About_alex.md).  


## Project 1: Hotel Cancelations prediction 
This project is based on the code made for the final project of the master’s course of Machine Learning at ITAM, in collaboration with my classmates [marcoyel21]( https://github.com/marcoyel21)  and [joelitam2021]( https://github.com/joelitam2021). 

### Problem description:
To plan rates and sales or promotional activities, hotels make advance estimates of their occupancy on each day. Part of these estimates requires predicting how many of the reservations you already have will end up in cancellations, which frees up inventory that affects planning.
### Objective: 
Predict which reservations are likely to end in cancellation or not.

### Strategy: 
Create variables and combinations exhaustively so that models perform feature selection autonomously.
