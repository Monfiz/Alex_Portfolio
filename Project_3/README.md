# Project 3: Analysis of coding and non-coding DNA

This project is based on my titling project to get my bachelor's degree on Physics Engineering with the help of my thesis director Master Gabriela Durán. It gets mathy quickly but in summary this is how it goes. 

The sections DNA of every organism can be classified into one of two groups, the first is [coding DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region) which is where the genes are, this is the part of the DNA that ends up being read by the ribosome and translated into proteins for the cell to do its process. The other sections of DNA end up being classified as non-coding DNA, which means those sections do not end up being read and making synthesis of proteins on a direct manner. This [non-coding DNA](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/higher-level/topic-7-nucleic-acids/71-dna-structure-and-replic/non-coding-dna.html) represents most of the genome in humans, genes only account for ~ 1.5% of the total sequence. The non-coding DNA is sometimes called “junk DNA” because its not clear its role, some investigations suggest it has a role in the expressions of the actual gens, but still non-coding DNA is a frontier subject in science. 

On this project I take coding and non-coding DNA from different organisms and apply the multi-fractal theory to measure the complexity of those sequences. To justify the use of this mathematical theory first I show that DNA shows a multi-fractal behavior by using an extension of the [game of chaos]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game). After showing this behavior on DNA I start counting subsequences on the DNA and apply the multi-fractal theory based on the frequencies of such subsequences. Finally data can be interpreted and the results show that coding DNA is more repetitive and less complex than non-coding DNA. This result makes sense, because we hope to see more regularity, structure and repetition inside genes than in non-coding DNA. 

During this project I wrote bunch of algorithms to make tasks from read the DNA data, clean and prepare the DNA,  show its structure with plots, make the subsequences, count the subsequences and plotting the complexity of the sequences.
